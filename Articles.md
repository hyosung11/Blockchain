## [20 Blockchain Predictions for 2020](https://money.com/ethereum-bitcoin-blockchain-predictions/) by Andrew Keys - January 7, 2020

1. Ethereum right now is like dial-up internet in 1996—14.4kbps. Soon it will be the equivalent of broadband.

2. Bitcoin and blockchain will finally break up.

3. The potential for global economic recession looms, fiat currencies be warned!
    - Digital assets have exiguous properties similar to gold and oil in that they are provenly scarce.*** If and when this crisis lands, the digital asset class will be the hedge to traditional central banking systems that resort to printing—and thus depreciating—currencies in times of crisis.

4. The U.S. will have to play catch-up after China’s big play in crypto and blockchain

5. We march on towards Ethereum 2.0
    - [The Roadamp to Serenity](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/the-roadmap-to-serenity-2/)

6. Layer two scaling solutions will turbocharge Ethereum
    - Poon and Buterik’s solution of Plasma’s “blockchains on blockchains” was not just brilliant and prescient, it was the inception of a whole sector of Layer Two development.
    - Sharded chains may occupy much of the debate at the moment, but state channels being developed by Celer, Connext, and Counterfactual will be the massive mycelial data network underground that unleashes the main chain to operate unencumbered by state weight.
    - Sidechains will transact the bulk of lower-risk transactions rapidly.
    - Payment channels like Raiden will enable instantaneous token transfers, while ZK-Snarks will keep all of your data private amidst all the transactional action.
    - The stack is all there, and 2020 will see 2.0 come to life.

7. Layers of the Web3.0 stack go live
    - Web3.0 will be defined by mesh networks connecting smart contracts, file storage, messaging, payment channels, side chains, oracles—the list goes on.
    - The digitization of all assets.
    - The automation of agreements
    - Self-Sovereign Identity
      - instead of the legacy application providers the same service will occur peer-to-peer, rather than through a thin layer of rent-seeking intermediation.

8. Expect a radically altered blockchain landscape by 2021
    - Competition is good and I remind everyone that the goal is global disintermediation, decentralization, and the commoditization of trust, rather than a brand of protocol winning.
    - New competitors to the layer 1 space will have to deal with Matteo Leibovitz’s “distribution quadrilemma,” which states criteria that new networks must simultaneously satisfy at launch to engender monetary premium. They are:
      1. wide/equitable distribution
      2. revenue generation
      3. potential for upside
      4. regulatorily compliant

9. The tribulations of Libra will continue ...

10. Trillion dollar companies signal the climax and end of the 3rd industrial revolution
    - Legacy Web2.0 companies are making billions for the shareholder capital class by using the individual as the product.

11. Self Sovereignty on the web will become a human right
    - Projects like the Decentralized Identity Foundation have taken major strides in establishing open source standards that will furnish the whole blockchain ecosystem with digital identity components that are trustworthy and decentralized.
    - Blockchain IDs and zero-trust datastores like those created by uPort and 3box will rapidly replace the creaky walled databases we rely on now.
    - Establishing this web of trust may be amongst the most important pieces of the blockchain puzzle in 2020.

12. Say it with me ... CME Ether futures
    - Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade

13. A billion dollar DeFi ecosystem is a matter of months away
    - Decentralized Finance

14. The sleeping giant of blockchain awakens — supply chain
    - Treum has already shown the value of blockchain-ensured supply chain processes on items ranging from salsa to tuna to skincare products.

15. Art and music will take a lead in consumer-interfacing blockchain applications
    - This year, I purchased a work of art titled “The Human Way” by Vladimir Kush. The payment, certificate of authenticity, and ownership history were irrevocably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain with Treum.

16. Proof of Work is dying while killing Earth. Long live Proof of Stake.
    - Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum were early adopters of the concept of Proof of Stake, and now there’s a whole industry of projects utilizing stake-based validators to uphold blockchain networks.

17. Regulators gonna regulate

18. The unbanked remain unbanked — For now
    - As it stands, the lending community is insular, and issues around ‘reputation’ mean that those who need it most can’t access it.
    - These will surely be ironed out over time, but for the duration of 2020, Decentralized Finance will continue to steadily grow in an enlarging, but closed circle.

19. User Experience Will Have To Be Better Than Web2.0
    - masterfully artistic UI/UX designers are as important to this industry right now as low layer distributed systems computer scientists.
    - [ Rimble](https://rimble.consensys.design/) is an example of an open-source library for creating improved user experiences for Web3.0 decentralized applications.

20. “If you’re going through hell… keep going” – Winston Churchill
    - We’re at the crossroads of the next industrial revolution, and it begins in 2020. This progress towards global decentralization and automation will lead to the most prosperous society we’ve ever had.
